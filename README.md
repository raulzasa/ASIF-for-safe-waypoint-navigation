# ASIF for safe waypoint navigation
Here you will find the code developed for the ASIF research for a bicycle kinematic model applied to safe waypoint navigation. In addition, the author highlights the loose ends so that if anyone wants to continue the work, there is a starting point. 

## Analytical Controlled Invariant Set
Starting from the kinematic cycle model, we assume constant velocity and that the steering angle does not vary between samples.
